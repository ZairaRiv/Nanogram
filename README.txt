Main info: Picross game developed for CSCI 130 game Fall 2018 

********************** INSTALL *****************************
just run install.php to get the gaming installed

*********************** ADD TXT ****************************
There are also some additional text files, but those are more 
for me. I included them because they still include my work, 
since it is old code. 
The main JS file includes a table of contents of the different
files that I used. They might be a little off because the last 
time I updated was a little bit before. There are some functions
that have to be called in order to show, and there are some
other functions that are not working right, but show no console 
errors. 

*********************** MAINTENANCE **************************
The maintenance for this in the future will be: 
adding more CSS
fixing picture elems
Deleting php files that are not being used, or that I have replaced
